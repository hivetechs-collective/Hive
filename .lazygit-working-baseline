This file marks the baseline state where LazyGit and terminals work properly.

Commit: da185ef - fix(analytics): resolve date comparison issues in analytics queries
Branch: fix/restore-lazygit-with-improvements
Status: VERIFIED WORKING

LazyGit Integration:
✅ LazyGit launches successfully
✅ Terminal displays properly
✅ Command parameter passing works correctly

Terminal System:
✅ Multiple terminals work
✅ Terminal tabs functional
✅ Terminal creation/closing works
✅ No resource leaks detected

This baseline was created after recovering from broken terminal implementations
that affected LazyGit functionality. All subsequent improvements should be
cherry-picked carefully while preserving this working state.

Created: $(date)
Recovery Strategy: Cherry-pick improvements individually with testing
