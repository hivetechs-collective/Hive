# Event Bus Implementation Summary

## Overview

The Event Bus system has been successfully implemented as specified in the Phase 2 Integration Roadmap. It provides a centralized, thread-safe publish-subscribe mechanism for managing events across the Hive desktop application.

## Completed Components

### 1. Core Event Bus (`bus.rs`)
- ✅ `EventBus` struct with thread-safe subscribers storage
- ✅ Support for both sync and async event handlers
- ✅ `subscribe()` and `subscribe_async()` methods
- ✅ `publish()` and `publish_async()` methods
- ✅ `unsubscribe()` functionality with subscription handles
- ✅ Thread-safe implementation using `Arc<RwLock<>>`
- ✅ Error handling that doesn't stop event propagation

### 2. Event Types (`types.rs`)
- ✅ `EventType` enum with all specified events:
  - GitStatusChanged
  - BuildStarted / BuildCompleted
  - FileChanged
  - RepositoryChanged
  - ProblemsUpdated
  - ConsensusStateChanged
  - TerminalOutput
  - UIStateChanged
  - ConfigurationChanged
  - ExtensionEvent
- ✅ `EventPayload` enum with type-safe payloads
- ✅ `Event` struct with helper methods
- ✅ Supporting types (Problem, ConsensusStage, etc.)

### 3. Global Instance (`global.rs`)
- ✅ Global singleton event bus via `GLOBAL_EVENT_BUS`
- ✅ `event_bus()` accessor function
- ✅ Lazy initialization with `once_cell`

### 4. Legacy Compatibility (`legacy.rs`)
- ✅ Preserved existing event handling code
- ✅ Maintained backwards compatibility

### 5. Documentation & Examples
- ✅ Comprehensive README.md
- ✅ Usage examples (`examples.rs`)
- ✅ Integration examples:
  - Git integration (`git_integration.rs`)
  - Problems panel integration (`problems_integration.rs`)
- ✅ Runnable demo (`examples/event_bus_demo.rs`)

### 6. Testing
- ✅ Unit tests for core functionality
- ✅ Integration tests (`tests/event_bus_integration.rs`)
- ✅ Cross-component communication tests
- ✅ Error handling tests

## Key Features

1. **Thread Safety**: All operations are thread-safe using `Arc<RwLock<>>`
2. **Async Support**: Full support for async handlers with proper pinning
3. **Type Safety**: Strongly typed events and payloads prevent runtime errors
4. **Performance**: Minimal overhead with efficient routing
5. **Flexibility**: Support for both sync and async publishing/subscribing
6. **Error Recovery**: Handler errors don't affect other subscribers

## Integration Points

The event bus is ready to be integrated with:

1. **Git Module**: Publish status changes, react to file modifications
2. **Build System**: Publish build start/complete events
3. **File Explorer**: React to file system changes
4. **Problems Panel**: Display diagnostics from various sources
5. **Status Bar**: Show real-time status from multiple components
6. **Consensus UI**: Display pipeline progress
7. **Terminal**: Publish output events
8. **Configuration**: React to settings changes

## Usage Example

```rust
use hive::desktop::events::{event_bus, Event, EventType, FileChangeType};

// Publishing
let bus = event_bus();
let event = Event::file_changed("/src/main.rs".into(), FileChangeType::Modified);
bus.publish_async(event).await?;

// Subscribing
bus.subscribe(EventType::FileChanged, |event| {
    println!("File changed: {:?}", event.payload);
    Ok(())
}).await;
```

## Next Steps

To fully integrate the event bus:

1. Update existing components to publish events
2. Replace direct component coupling with event subscriptions
3. Add event bus initialization to application startup
4. Monitor performance and adjust as needed

The event bus is now ready for use throughout the Hive desktop application, providing a robust foundation for loose coupling and reactive updates.
