# ðŸŽ‰ Fixed! Consensus Engine Now Uses Saved Config

## What Was Fixed:

The consensus engine was still checking for environment variables instead of using the saved config. I've updated it to:

1. **Load config on startup** - Reads from `~/.hive/config.toml`
2. **Extract API key** - Gets the OpenRouter key from the config
3. **Pass to pipeline** - Provides the key when making API calls
4. **Better error messages** - Suggests running setup instead of setting env vars

## To Test Again:

```bash
cd npm
./bin/hive tui
```

Or test the ask command directly:
```bash
./bin/hive ask "What is Rust programming language?"
```

## What Should Happen Now:

- âœ… No more "demo mode" messages
- âœ… Real AI responses using your OpenRouter API key
- âœ… The 4-stage consensus pipeline with actual AI models
- âœ… Your questions processed by Claude, GPT-4, etc.

## Your Saved Config:

Your setup successfully saved:
- **OpenRouter API Key**: âœ“ Configured
- **Hive License Key**: âœ“ Configured  
- **Profile**: Balanced (using best models)

The consensus engine will now use these saved credentials automatically!

## Database:

The SQLite database at `~/.hive/hive-ai.db` is ready but currently empty. As you use Hive AI, it will:
- Store conversation history
- Build semantic memory
- Track usage and costs
- Enable context continuity

Everything is now connected and should work with real AI responses!
