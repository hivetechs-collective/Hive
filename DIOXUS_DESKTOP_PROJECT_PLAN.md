# Weekly feature branches
git checkout -b feature/week-1-foundation
git checkout -b feature/week-2-core-components
# etc.

# Daily tags for tracking
git tag -a week-1-day-3 -m "File explorer basic functionality complete"
```

### Quality Gates (Never Skip)
**Before any commit:**
```bash
# Build check
cargo build --release

# Test suite
cargo test --all-features

# Performance check
cargo run --release -- --benchmark

# Memory usage check
cargo run --release -- --memory-profile

# Cross-platform check (CI handles this)
```

### Parallel Agent Strategy
For complex tasks, spawn specialized agents:
- **UI Agent**: Focus on Dioxus components and layout
- **Performance Agent**: Monitor memory, speed, binary size
- **Integration Agent**: Handle consensus engine connection
- **Testing Agent**: Comprehensive test coverage
- **Documentation Agent**: Keep docs current

## 📊 Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics (Tracked Daily)
| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| Startup Time | <50ms | TBD | 🟡 |
| Memory Usage | <25MB | TBD | 🟡 |
| Binary Size | <8MB | TBD | 🟡 |
| File Tree Load | <100ms | TBD | 🟡 |
| Consensus Response | <500ms | TBD | 🟡 |

### Performance Testing
```rust
// Automated benchmarks
#[bench]
fn bench_file_tree_load(b: &mut Bencher) {
    b.iter(|| load_large_project_tree())
}

#[bench] 
fn bench_consensus_engine(b: &mut Bencher) {
    b.iter(|| process_consensus_request("test query"))
}
```

## 🔒 Security & Trust System

### File Access Security
- **Explicit Permission**: Ask before accessing any files
- **Trust Persistence**: Remember user decisions
- **Audit Logging**: Log all file operations
- **Sandboxing**: Limit file system access scope

### Implementation
```rust
// Trust dialog for new directories
if !trust_manager.is_trusted(&project_path) {
    let permission = show_trust_dialog(&project_path).await;
    trust_manager.set_trust(&project_path, permission);
}
```

## 📝 QA & Testing Strategy

### Automated Testing
1. **Unit Tests**: Every component and function
2. **Integration Tests**: Full workflow testing
3. **Performance Tests**: Benchmark critical paths
4. **UI Tests**: Component rendering and interaction
5. **Security Tests**: File access and permissions

### Manual Testing
1. **Cross-Platform**: Test on Windows, macOS, Linux
2. **User Workflows**: Complete user journey testing
3. **Performance**: Real-world usage scenarios
4. **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation, screen readers
5. **Edge Cases**: Large projects, network issues

### Acceptance Criteria
Each feature must pass:
- ✅ All automated tests
- ✅ Performance benchmarks
- ✅ Security review
- ✅ Cross-platform testing
- ✅ User experience validation

## 🚀 Distribution Strategy

### Release Channels
1. **GitHub Releases**: Primary distribution
2. **Package Managers**: Homebrew, Chocolatey, Snap
3. **Direct Download**: Professional installers
4. **Auto-Updates**: Built-in update mechanism

### Binary Optimization
```toml
[profile.release]
opt-level = 3
