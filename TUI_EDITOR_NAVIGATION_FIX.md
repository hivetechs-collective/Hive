# TUI Editor Navigation Fix Summary

## Problem
The `handle_editor_navigation` function in `src/tui/advanced/editor.rs` returned `Result<bool, Error>` but was being wrapped in another `Ok()` on line 498, creating a type mismatch.

## Root Cause
The code had a borrowing issue where:
1. `self.current_tab_mut()` created a mutable borrow of `self`
2. `self.handle_editor_navigation()` tried to borrow `self` mutably again
3. This violated Rust's borrowing rules

## Solution
Restructured the code to avoid double borrowing:

1. Created `handle_editor_navigation_by_index` that takes a tab index instead of using `current_tab_mut()`
2. Made `handle_tab_navigation` a static method that doesn't need `self`
3. Created `update_scroll_offset_static` as a static version to avoid borrowing conflicts
4. Changed the navigation handling to work with indices rather than direct mutable references

## Code Changes

### Before:
```rust
_ => {
    if let Some(tab) = self.current_tab_mut() {
        Ok(self.handle_editor_navigation(tab, key).await)  // Wrong: Result<Result<bool>>
    } else {
        Ok(false)
    }
}
```

### After:
```rust
_ => {
    if self.active_tab < self.tabs.len() {
        self.handle_editor_navigation_by_index(self.active_tab, key).await  // Correct: Result<bool>
    } else {
        Ok(false)
    }
}
```

## Key Learnings
1. When dealing with mutable borrows in Rust, consider using indices instead of references
2. Static methods can help avoid borrowing conflicts when the method doesn't need access to `self`
3. Splitting complex operations into smaller, focused methods can resolve borrowing issues

## Status
✅ The specific editor navigation return type error has been fixed
✅ No more borrowing conflicts in the editor navigation code
✅ The editor module compiles without errors
