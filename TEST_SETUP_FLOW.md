# TUI Setup Flow Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. First-Launch Setup Flow
- Created `src/tui/setup.rs` with a complete setup wizard
- Detects if configuration is missing on TUI launch
- Shows a Claude Code-style setup experience within the TUI

### 2. Setup Steps
1. **Welcome Screen** - Explains what will be configured
2. **OpenRouter API Key** - Prompts for API key with validation
3. **Hive License Key** - Prompts for license key  
4. **Validation** - Shows progress while validating credentials
5. **Completion** - Confirms setup and transitions to main TUI

### 3. Key Features
- **Secure Input**: API keys are masked during entry
- **Validation**: Checks key format before accepting
- **Persistence**: Saves to `~/.hive/config.toml`
- **Environment Setup**: Sets OPENROUTER_API_KEY for current session
- **Seamless Transition**: After setup, loads directly into main TUI

### 4. Integration Points
- Modified `TuiFramework` to check for setup needs
- Added `reload_consensus_engine()` to reload after config
- Updated `main.rs` to load config and set env vars

## How It Works

1. **On TUI Launch**: 
   ```rust
   ./target/release/hive tui
   ```

2. **First-Time Detection**:
   - Checks if `~/.hive/config.toml` exists
   - Verifies OpenRouter API key is configured
   - If missing, shows setup flow

3. **User Experience**:
   - Navigate with arrow keys
   - Enter keys when prompted
   - Keys are masked for security
   - Real-time validation feedback

4. **After Setup**:
   - Config saved to disk
   - Environment variables set
   - Consensus engine reloaded
   - Ready to use AI features

## Testing Instructions

Since you can't interact with the TUI in this environment, here's how to test locally:

1. **Remove existing config**:
   ```bash
   rm -f ~/.hive/config.toml
   ```

2. **Launch TUI**:
   ```bash
   ./target/release/hive tui
   ```

3. **You should see**:
   - Welcome screen explaining setup
   - Press Enter to continue
   - OpenRouter API key prompt
   - Enter your key (starts with `sk-or-`)
   - Hive license key prompt
   - Enter your license
   - Success message
   - Main TUI interface

4. **Verify config created**:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.hive/config.toml
   ```

## Benefits

- **No Manual Config**: Users don't need to edit files
- **Guided Experience**: Clear instructions at each step
- **Immediate Feedback**: Validation shows errors instantly
- **Secure**: Keys are masked and stored safely
- **Seamless**: One-time setup, then straight to work

This provides the Claude Code-like experience you requested where users are prompted for their API keys on first launch!
