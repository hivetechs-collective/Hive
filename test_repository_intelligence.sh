# Test Results Summary
echo "📊 Expected Results Summary:"
echo ""
echo "🏗️  Architecture Analysis:"
echo "   - Should detect: MVC pattern"
echo "   - Confidence: >0.6 (UserController + UserModel components)"
echo "   - Components: Controller, Model components identified"
echo ""
echo "📈 Quality Analysis:"
echo "   - Overall Score: <7.0 (due to complexity and issues)"
echo "   - Issues: High complexity methods, missing documentation"
echo "   - Hotspots: main.rs, UserController::create_user"
echo ""
echo "🔒 Security Analysis:"
echo "   - Vulnerabilities: ≥1 (hardcoded secret 'hardcoded_secret')"
echo "   - Risk Score: >0 (should detect credential in code)"
echo ""
echo "⚡ Performance Analysis:"
echo "   - Hotspots: ≥2 (nested loops, N+1 pattern, inefficient recursion)"
echo "   - Issues: O(n³) loops, database queries in loops"
echo ""
echo "💰 Technical Debt:"
echo "   - Estimated Cost: >$1000 (multiple issues to fix)"
echo "   - Debt Items: Code duplication, missing tests, complexity"
