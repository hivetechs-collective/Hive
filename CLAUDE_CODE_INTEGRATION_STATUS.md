# Claude Code Integration Status - BREAKTHROUGH: True Hybrid Architecture

## 🚀 ARCHITECTURAL BREAKTHROUGH - Complete Redesign

**CRITICAL INSIGHT**: We were building a Claude Code-like interface instead of embedding real Claude Code. The user wants **the exact same experience as talking to Claude Code directly** (with slash command autocomplete, native authentication, etc.) **PLUS** all our Hive capabilities.

## 🔴 CURRENT STATUS: Claude Code CLI Not Installed

**The integration is fully implemented but requires Claude Code CLI to be installed on the system.**

### System Check Results:
```bash
$ which claude
claude not found
$ which claude-code  
claude-code not found
```

### What This Means:
- ✅ All code is implemented and ready
- ✅ Binary detection logic is comprehensive
- ❌ Cannot test until Claude Code CLI is installed
- ❌ Users will see "Claude Code integration not available" message

## New Vision: True Hybrid Experience

## Key Architectural Decisions

### ⭐ **BREAKTHROUGH: Hybrid Architecture Pattern**
- **Embed Real Claude Code** as subprocess instead of reimplementing
- **Smart Command Router** intercepts Hive commands, passes others through
- **Bidirectional Communication** with native Claude Code process
- **Response Integration Layer** enhances Claude outputs with Hive context

### 1. **Command Routing Strategy**
```rust
// Hive-specific commands (handled by us)
const HIVE_COMMANDS: &[&str] = &[
    "/consensus",        // 4-stage consensus pipeline
    "/hive-consensus",   // Alias for consensus
    "/memory",           // Thematic memory search
    "/openrouter",       // Direct OpenRouter model access
    "/hive-analyze",     // Repository analysis
    "/hive-learn",       // Continuous learning insights
];

// Everything else goes to native Claude Code
```

### 2. **Process Management**
- **Subprocess Spawning**: Real Claude Code binary as child process
- **Communication Protocol**: stdin/stdout with JSON message format
- **State Synchronization**: Authentication status, current directory
- **Error Handling**: Process monitoring and recovery

### 3. **Enhanced Response Integration**
- **Memory Context Injection**: Add relevant thematic knowledge
- **Repository Intelligence**: Enhance responses with code context
- **Learning Insights**: Include patterns from continuous learning
- **Consensus Hooks**: Optional validation for complex decisions

## Key Files Modified/To Modify

### Modified:
- `/src/core/api_keys.rs` - Complete API key management for Anthropic
- `/src/desktop/dialogs/mod.rs` - Added Anthropic key fields to dialogs
- `/src/bin/hive-consensus.rs` - Added anthropic_key signal and partially updated

### To Create:
- `/src/consensus/claude_code_executor.rs` - Main Claude integration
- `/src/consensus/claude_process.rs` - SDK subprocess management
- `/src/consensus/claude_hooks.rs` - Hook system for consensus

### To Modify:
- `/src/consensus/engine.rs` - Add Claude executor option
- `/src/consensus/mode_detector.rs` - Route to Claude instead of Direct
- `/src/core/database.rs` - Ensure knowledge storage works

## Critical Implementation Notes

### API Key Handling
- API keys stored in database only (not config.toml)
- Same pattern as OpenRouter keys
- Validation before saving
- Environment variable fallback

### Stateless Context Building
```rust
async fn build_stateless_context(&self, request: &str) -> Result<StatelessContext> {
    // Get recent curator knowledge (24h window)
    let recent_knowledge = self.thematic_cluster
        .get_recent_curator_knowledge(request).await?;
    
    // Get thematic matches
    let thematic_knowledge = self.thematic_cluster
        .get_thematic_knowledge(request, "direct").await?;
    
    // Get learned patterns from ContinuousLearner
    let learned_context = self.ai_helpers.continuous_learner
        .get_learned_context(request, Stage::Generator, 5000).await?;
    
    Ok(StatelessContext {
        recent_knowledge,
        thematic_knowledge,
        learned_patterns: learned_context,
        repository_context: repo_context,
    })
}
```

### System Prompt
```rust
const HYBRID_SYSTEM_PROMPT: &str = r#"
You are Claude Code integrated with Hive Consensus, operating in stateless mode.

Key principles:
1. Each request is independent - you have no conversation history
2. The context provided contains relevant past knowledge from the memory system
3. When uncertain about complex decisions, explicitly state "I would benefit from consensus validation"
4. All your outputs will be stored as knowledge for future requests
5. You have full access to all Claude Code capabilities and commands

Available context includes:
- Recent curator knowledge (authoritative answers from past 24h)
- Thematically similar past conversations
- Learned patterns and best practices
- Repository context when applicable
"#;
```

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Find OnboardingDialog usage**:
   ```bash
   grep -r "OnboardingDialog" src/bin/hive-consensus.rs
   ```

2. **Implement save_api_keys function**:
   ```rust
   async fn save_api_keys(
       openrouter_key: &str,
       hive_key: &str,
       anthropic_key: &str,
   ) -> Result<()> {
       ApiKeyManager::save_to_database(
           Some(openrouter_key),
           Some(hive_key),
           Some(anthropic_key),
       ).await
   }
   ```

3. **Hook up save in dialogs**:
   - In SettingsDialog "Save" button onclick
   - In OnboardingDialog "Continue" button onclick

4. **Test the flow**:
   - Open settings
   - Enter Anthropic API key
   - Save
   - Restart app
   - Verify key persists
