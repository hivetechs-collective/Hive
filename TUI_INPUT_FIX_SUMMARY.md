# TUI Input Handler Fix Summary

## Overview
Fixed the TUI input handler to properly process user input and connect it to the ConsensusEngine for real-time 4-stage consensus processing.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced InputHandler (`src/tui/input.rs`)
- Added `consensus_engine` field to store reference to ConsensusEngine
- Added `with_consensus_engine()` constructor to create handler with engine
- Added `set_consensus_engine()` method to set engine after creation
- Modified `process_ask_command()` to use real consensus engine when available
- Added `process_with_real_consensus()` method that:
  - Creates ConsensusRequest from user input
  - Calls `engine.process_with_streaming()` to get streaming responses
  - Processes StreamingResponse events and updates TUI progress
  - Displays final consensus response with metadata
- Changed default behavior: any unrecognized input is now treated as an "ask" command

### 2. Updated TuiApp (`src/tui/app.rs`)
- Added import for ConsensusEngine
- Modified `new()` to create ConsensusEngine instance
- Pass engine to InputHandler via `with_consensus_engine()`

### 3. Added Required Imports
- Added consensus engine imports to input.rs
- Added Arc for thread-safe reference counting
- Added necessary types from consensus module

## How It Works Now

1. **User Types Input**: When user types text and hits Enter in the TUI
2. **Command Processing**: InputHandler checks if it's a command (help, status, ask, analyze, plan)
3. **Default to Ask**: If not a recognized command, treats input as an "ask" query
4. **Consensus Processing**: 
   - Creates ConsensusRequest with the query
   - Calls ConsensusEngine's `process_with_streaming()` method
   - Receives streaming updates for each stage (Generator, Refiner, Validator, Curator)
5. **Progress Display**: Updates TUI with real-time progress for each stage
6. **Final Response**: Shows the consensus result with quality metrics

## Current Status

- ✅ Input handler properly connected to ConsensusEngine
- ✅ Streaming updates processed and displayed in TUI
- ✅ User can type questions directly (no "ask" prefix needed)
- ✅ Progress bars update for each consensus stage
- ✅ Final response shows with metadata (cost, time, models used)

## Note

The ConsensusEngine currently returns placeholder responses during development. Once the OpenRouter integration is complete, it will provide actual AI consensus responses from the 4-stage pipeline.

## Testing

Run the TUI with:
```bash
cargo run -- tui
```

Then type any question and press Enter to see the consensus processing in action.
