# Remaining Issues for Future Fixes

## Successfully Fixed
✅ Hooks integration reconnected in consensus pipeline
✅ Added 7 missing expert profiles (now 10 total)
✅ Compilation issues resolved
✅ MCP command added to CLI structure
✅ Release binary built successfully (13.3MB)

## Critical Issues Remaining

### 1. Database System (CRITICAL)
- ❌ Using simplified schema with only 5 tables vs 10 required
- ❌ Missing tables: stages, analytics, thematic_clusters, sync_status, embeddings  
- ❌ Cloudflare D1 sync NOT implemented
- ❌ Migration only has placeholders
- ❌ Thematic clustering algorithm not connected

**Fix Required**: 
- Use full database schema from TypeScript version
- Implement Cloudflare sync protocol
- Connect thematic clustering

### 2. OpenRouter Integration (CRITICAL)
- ❌ Using simplified OpenRouter client
- ❌ Missing full model routing logic
- ❌ Cost calculation simplified
- ❌ Rate limiting not fully implemented

**Fix Required**:
- Replace simplified client with full implementation
- Add proper model routing and fallbacks
- Implement accurate cost tracking

### 3. Command Execution Layer
- ❌ Many commands return mock data or placeholders
- ❌ Cost command not connected to real data
- ❌ Memory commands simplified
- ❌ Analytics not collecting from consensus
- ❌ Search not using full index capabilities

**Fix Required**:
- Connect commands to actual implementations
- Remove placeholder responses
- Wire up data collection

### 4. IDE Integration
- ❌ MCP server command added but not accessible via CLI
- ❌ LSP server disabled in code
- ❌ VS Code extension not packaged
- ✅ Full implementations exist but disconnected

**Fix Required**:
- Make MCP/LSP commands accessible
- Enable server implementations
- Package VS Code extension

### 5. Enterprise Features
- ✅ Hooks connected but need testing
- ❌ Quality gates not enforced
- ❌ Approval workflows stubbed
- ❌ Notification systems not wired

**Fix Required**:
- Test hooks integration thoroughly
- Implement quality gate enforcement
- Connect approval and notification systems

## Performance & Polish

### Warnings to Address
- 640+ compiler warnings (mostly unused imports/variables)
- Run `cargo fix --lib -p hive-ai` to apply 261 automatic fixes

### Testing Needed
- Integration tests with real OpenRouter API
- Database migration from TypeScript version
- TUI interface testing on various terminals
- Performance benchmarks vs TypeScript

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Build release binary
cargo build --release

# Run with API key
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key ./target/release/hive ask "test question"

# Check what's working
./target/release/hive --help
./target/release/hive analyze .
./target/release/hive tui --force

# Install globally (after testing)
sudo cp target/release/hive /usr/local/bin/
```

## Priority Order for Fixes

1. **Database Schema** - Foundation for everything else
2. **OpenRouter Client** - Core consensus functionality  
3. **Command Connections** - Make existing features work
4. **IDE Integration** - Enable MCP/LSP access
5. **Testing & Polish** - Ensure production readiness

## Time Estimate
- 4-8 hours to connect all existing implementations
- Most code is already written, just needs wiring
- No major new development required
