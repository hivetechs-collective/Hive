# Consensus GUI Freezing Fix - Implementation Tracking

## üö® Critical Issue
**Problem**: GUI freezes when running consensus, system overheats, app becomes unresponsive
**Root Cause**: Consensus running on Dioxus's single-threaded runtime instead of Tokio

## üìç Current State
- **Current Branch**: `fix/restore-lazygit-with-improvements`
- **Safe Rollback Commit**: `b3fa9f0` - "fix(terminal): resolve display bug by starting with no terminals and improving PTY sizing"
- **Date**: 2025-08-07
- **Status**: Starting implementation

## üéØ Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate Fix (PARTIALLY COMPLETE)
- [x] Attempted to replace `dioxus::prelude::spawn` with `tokio::spawn` at line 4983
- [x] Added ConsensusMessage enum for future communication
- [x] Discovered blocker: DesktopConsensusManager is not Send due to Dioxus Signal<AppState>
- [ ] Need to refactor DesktopConsensusManager to separate Send-able engine from UI state
- [ ] Test that UI remains responsive during consensus
- [ ] Verify CPU usage is distributed across cores

**Blocker Found**: Cannot move consensus to Tokio thread because DesktopConsensusManager contains non-Send Dioxus signals. Need deeper refactoring.

### Phase 2: Thread Isolation (PARTIALLY COMPLETE)
- [x] Wrap AI helper initialization in `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`
  - Modified AIHelperEcosystem::new() to use spawn_blocking for:
    - Model downloading
    - Python service initialization
    - Vector store creation
    - All helper component initialization
- [ ] Add progress reporting from background threads
- [ ] Implement proper cancellation tokens
- [ ] Cache AI helpers between consensus runs
- [ ] Add timeout handling for long operations

### Phase 3: Lazy Initialization
- [ ] Make AI helper creation lazy (on-demand)
- [ ] Move Python model loading to background
- [ ] Add initialization state tracking
- [ ] Implement progress UI for initialization
- [ ] Add error recovery for failed initialization

## üìù Implementation Details

### File Modifications Required

#### 1. `src/bin/hive-consensus.rs` (Primary Fix Location)
**Line 4983**: Change spawn implementation
```rust
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
let task = spawn(async move { ... });  // This is dioxus::prelude::spawn

// AFTER (FIXED):
// Create channel for communication
let (tx, mut rx) = tokio::sync::mpsc::channel(100);

// Spawn on Tokio runtime
let task = tokio::spawn(async move {
    // Heavy consensus work here
    let result = consensus.process_query_streaming(&enhanced_query).await;
    let _ = tx.send(result).await;
});

// Handle results on UI thread
spawn(async move {
    while let Some(result) = rx.recv().await {
        // Update UI safely
    }
});
```

#### 2. `src/desktop/consensus_integration.rs`
- Wrap ConsensusPipeline creation in spawn_blocking
- Add lazy initialization flag
- Cache pipeline instance

#### 3. `src/ai_helpers/mod.rs`
- Line 245: Make `AIHelperEcosystem::new()` use spawn_blocking
- Line 341: Move model downloading to background
- Add progress callbacks

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Immediate Tests (After Phase 1)
- [ ] Build successfully with `cargo build --bin hive-consensus`
- [ ] Launch GUI without errors
- [ ] Run consensus query
- [ ] Verify UI remains clickable during consensus
- [ ] Check CPU usage with Activity Monitor
- [ ] Test cancellation with Ctrl+C
- [ ] Verify no system overheating

### Performance Metrics to Track
- UI responsiveness during consensus (should be <16ms frame time)
- CPU usage distribution (should use multiple cores)
- Memory usage (should not spike on UI thread)
- Consensus completion time (should be similar or better)
- System temperature (should not cause thermal throttling)

## üîç Key Code Locations

1. **Spawn Call**: `/src/bin/hive-consensus.rs:4983`
   - This is where `dioxus::prelude::spawn` needs to be replaced

2. **Consensus Creation**: `/src/desktop/consensus_integration.rs:28-89`
   - Heavy initialization happening here

3. **AI Helper Init**: `/src/ai_helpers/mod.rs:245-339`
   - Multiple blocking operations during initialization

4. **Python Service**: `/src/ai_helpers/python_models.rs`
   - Synchronous Python initialization

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Rollback Plan

If implementation fails or causes new issues:

```bash
# Rollback to last known good commit
git reset --hard b3fa9f0

# Or if we've committed, revert the changes
git revert HEAD
```

## üìä Progress Tracking

### Session 1 (Current)
- [x] Identified root cause: wrong async runtime
- [x] Created tracking document
- [ ] Implementing Phase 1 fix
- [ ] Testing basic functionality

### Success Criteria
1. ‚úÖ GUI remains responsive during consensus
2. ‚úÖ CPU usage distributed across cores
3. ‚úÖ No system overheating
4. ‚úÖ Cancellation works properly
5. ‚úÖ No regression in consensus quality

## üöÄ Next Steps After Fix

Once immediate fix is verified:
1. Implement Phase 2 (thread isolation)
2. Implement Phase 3 (lazy initialization)
3. Continue with Dioxus copy plan for long-term solution
4. Add resource governor to copied Dioxus

## üìù Notes

- The root issue is that Dioxus uses a WASM-compatible single-threaded runtime
- Tokio is already in our dependencies and runs on a separate thread pool
- This fix is temporary until we copy and modify Dioxus source
- Keep commits small and semantic for easy rollback
