# Professional Distribution Plan for Hive IDE

## Overview
This plan implements professional distribution with Apple signing for macOS while keeping Windows and Linux cost-effective until revenue justifies additional certificates.

## Phase 1: Apple Developer Setup ✅ COMPLETED

### 1. Enroll in Apple Developer Program ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Enrolled with Apple Developer Program as **HiveTechs Collective LLC**
- ✅ Cost: $99/year (payment processed)
- ⏳ Processing: May take up to 48 hours for full activation
- ✅ Will provide both certificates needed for professional distribution

### 2. Create Required Certificates ⏳ PENDING APPLE APPROVAL
- ⏳ **Developer ID Application** - for app signing (pending Apple approval)
- ⏳ **Developer ID Installer** - for DMG signing (pending Apple approval)
- ✅ Process documented for when certificates are available
- ✅ Scripts auto-detect certificates and fallback gracefully

### 3. Update macOS Build Scripts ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ `scripts/sign-macos.sh` updated with certificate auto-detection
- ✅ Ad-hoc signing implemented as fallback (eliminates "damaged" error)
- ✅ Full notarization workflow ready for when certificates arrive
- ✅ `scripts/create-dmg.sh` creates professional DMG installer

### 4. Implement Notarization Workflow ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Notarization step after signing (when certificates available)
- ✅ Uses `xcrun notarytool` for submission
- ✅ Staples ticket to app for offline verification
- ✅ Full professional workflow matching VS Code, Docker, etc.

### 5. Distribution Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Professional DMG created: `Hive-IDE-2.0.2.dmg` (5.3MB)
- ✅ Ad-hoc signed to prevent "damaged app" error
- ✅ Professional R2 distribution structure implemented
- ✅ Uploaded to `https://releases.hivetechs.io/stable/`
- ✅ Download experience tested and verified working
- ✅ Users can install with right-click → Open (standard for new developers)

## Phase 2: Windows Professional Approach (Free)

### 1. Create MSI Installer
- Use WiX Toolset (free, professional-grade)
- Embed company information properly
- Include proper uninstaller
- More trusted than raw EXE files

### 2. Enhance Trust Signals
- Add version information in binary
- Embed company details in properties
- Ensure HTTPS download from your domain
- Create clear installation guide

### 3. Update Downloads Page for Windows
- Note about one-time SmartScreen approval
- Position as "standard for new software"
- Emphasize secure HTTPS delivery
- Professional presentation

## Phase 3: Linux Standard Distribution

### 1. Create AppImage
- Universal format that works everywhere
- Single file, no installation needed
- Include icon and desktop integration
- Follow AppImage best practices

### 2. Add Security Features
- Generate SHA256 checksums for all downloads
- Display checksums on downloads page
- Provide verification instructions
- Optional: GPG sign the checksums file

## Phase 4: Update R2 Distribution Structure

### 1. New File Organization
```
releases.hivetechs.io/
├── stable/
│   ├── Hive-2.0.2-macOS.dmg (signed & notarized)
│   ├── Hive-2.0.2-Windows.msi 
│   ├── Hive-2.0.2-Linux.AppImage
│   └── checksums.sha256
├── beta/
│   └── (same structure)
└── install.sh (optional universal installer)
```

### 2. Update releases.json
- Include signature status for each platform
- Add direct download URLs
- Version information
- Update check compatibility

## Phase 5: Professional Downloads Page

### 1. Update UI/UX
- Show Apple verification badge for macOS
- Clear messaging about Windows first-run experience
- Professional design matching your brand
- Platform-specific installation instructions

### 2. Installation Guides by Platform

**macOS** (with Apple signing):
- "Download and run - fully verified by Apple"
- Zero warnings or security prompts
- Drag to Applications and launch

**Windows** (without signing initially):
- "One-time security approval on first run"
- Professional MSI installer
- Clear instructions for SmartScreen override
- Note: Future launches have no warnings

**Linux**:
- "Download, make executable, and run"
- Standard AppImage experience
- Works on all major distributions

## Cost Analysis

### Initial Investment
- **macOS**: $99/year (Apple Developer Program)
- **Windows**: $0 (MSI installer with clear instructions)
- **Linux**: $0 (standard distribution)
- **Total**: $99/year

### Future Scaling (Revenue-Based)
- **At 50 customers**: Add Windows code signing (~$300/year)
- **At 200 customers**: Consider EV certificate for instant trust
- **Scale with revenue**: Total ~$400/year when sustainable
