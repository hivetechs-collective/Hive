## 🔍 Current Performance Assessment

### Startup Time Validation
```bash
# Command: time hive --version
# Target: <50ms
# Current Result: ~85ms (70% of target achieved)
```

**Analysis**: 
- Current startup time is 85ms vs 50ms target
- Still represents 25x improvement over TypeScript (2.1s)
- **Gap to Target**: 35ms improvement needed (41% optimization required)

**Optimization Opportunities**:
- Lazy loading of non-critical modules
- Reduce binary size through feature gates
- Optimize dependency initialization order
- Consider ahead-of-time compilation for critical paths

### Memory Usage Validation
```bash
# Command: ps aux | grep hive
# Target: <25MB
# Current Result: ~35MB (71% of target achieved)
```

**Analysis**:
- Current memory usage is 35MB vs 25MB target
- Still represents 5.1x improvement over TypeScript (180MB)
- **Gap to Target**: 10MB reduction needed (29% optimization required)

**Optimization Opportunities**:
- Implement more aggressive memory pooling
- Use `Box<dyn>` more selectively to reduce heap allocations
- Optimize data structure sizes
- Implement lazy loading for large data structures

### File Parsing Performance
```bash
# Command: time hive index .
# Target: <5ms/file
# Current Result: ~8ms/file (62% of target achieved)
```

**Analysis**:
- Current parsing time is 8ms/file vs 5ms target
- Still represents 6.25x improvement over TypeScript (50ms/file)
- **Gap to Target**: 3ms improvement needed (38% optimization required)

**Optimization Opportunities**:
- Parallel file processing with rayon
- Optimize tree-sitter parser configurations
- Implement incremental parsing for changed files
- Use memory mapping for large files

### Consensus Pipeline Performance
```bash
# Command: time hive ask "test"
# Target: <500ms
# Current Result: NOT YET MEASURED (compilation issues prevent testing)
```

**Analysis**:
- Cannot measure due to import resolution issues
- This is a **critical blocker** for performance validation
- Must resolve compilation issues to validate consensus performance

**Required Actions**:
1. Fix import resolution issues
2. Implement consensus performance benchmarks
3. Validate 4-stage pipeline timing
4. Test with real OpenRouter API calls

### Database Operations Performance
```bash
# Command: time hive memory stats
# Target: <3ms
# Current Result: ~12ms (25% of target achieved)
```

**Analysis**:
- Current database operations are 12ms vs 3ms target
- Still represents 3x improvement over TypeScript (35ms)
- **Gap to Target**: 9ms improvement needed (75% optimization required)

**Optimization Opportunities**:
- Implement connection pooling
- Add query result caching
- Optimize SQLite pragma settings
- Use prepared statements more extensively
