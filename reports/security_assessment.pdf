```rust
// Trust dialog implementation
pub struct TrustDialog {
    pub directory: PathBuf,
    pub trust_level: TrustLevel,
    pub permissions: Vec<Permission>,
    pub expires_at: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,
}
```

**Features Validated**:
- ✅ Per-directory trust decisions
- ✅ Persistent trust storage

- ✅ Trust expiration mechanisms
- ✅ Audit trail for trust decisions

### RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
**Status**: ✅ **PRODUCTION READY**

Enterprise-grade role-based access control system:

```rust
pub struct EnterpriseUser {
    pub roles: Vec<String>,
    pub security_groups: Vec<String>,
    pub permissions: HashMap<String, Permission>,
    pub risk_level: RiskLevel,
}
```

**Features Validated**:
- ✅ Hierarchical role system
- ✅ Security group management
- ✅ Fine-grained permissions
- ✅ Risk level assessments
- ✅ Multi-factor authentication support

### Audit System
**Status**: ✅ **PRODUCTION READY**

Comprehensive audit logging for compliance:

```rust
pub struct AuditEvent {
    pub event_type: AuditEventType,
    pub user_id: String,
    pub resource: String,
    pub action: String,
    pub outcome: AuditOutcome,
    pub timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,
}
```

**Features Validated**:
- ✅ Complete action logging
- ✅ Tamper-proof audit trails
- ✅ Compliance reporting
- ✅ Security event correlation
- ✅ Real-time alerting
