# Quick Start: Get Tauri Version Running NOW

## 🚀 Immediate Steps to See It Working

### Step 1: Install Frontend Dependencies (2 minutes)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Step 2: Build the Rust Backend (5 minutes)
```bash
cd ../src-tauri
cargo build
```

### Step 3: Run in Development Mode (1 minute)
```bash
cd ..
npm run tauri:dev --prefix frontend
```

This will:
1. Start the Vite dev server for React
2. Compile the Rust backend
3. Launch the Tauri app window
4. Open DevTools if in debug mode

## 🔧 Quick Fixes for Common Issues

### If `npm run tauri:dev` fails:
```bash
# Fix 1: Update tauri.conf.json paths
# Change frontendDist from "../dist" to "../frontend/dist"
# Change devUrl to "http://localhost:5173"

# Fix 2: Install missing dependencies
cd src-tauri
cargo update
cd ../frontend
npm install @tauri-apps/cli
```

### If consensus doesn't work:
```bash
# The backend needs your existing database
# It will use ~/.hive/hive-ai.db automatically
# Make sure you have API keys configured
```

## 📦 Creating Your First Build

```bash
# Build for your current platform
cd frontend
npm run build
cd ..
cargo tauri build

# Find your app:
# macOS: src-tauri/target/release/bundle/dmg/
# Windows: src-tauri/target/release/bundle/msi/
# Linux: src-tauri/target/release/bundle/deb/
```

## 🎯 What Works Right Now

With the current migration:

✅ **Working Features:**
- Consensus engine (full 4-stage pipeline)
- Progress tracking with streaming
- File system operations
- Basic React UI with Ant Design
- IPC communication
- Settings management

🚧 **Needs Implementation:**
- Terminal with PTY
- LazyGit integration  
- File explorer tree view
- Monaco editor
- Analytics dashboard
- Git status in status bar

## 📝 Next Priority: Get Terminal Working

The terminal is critical for feature parity. Here's the fastest approach:

### Option 1: Use node-pty with WebSocket (Recommended)
```bash
# Install in frontend
npm install node-pty xterm xterm-addon-fit

# Create WebSocket server in Tauri
# Stream PTY output to frontend
# This gives full terminal functionality
```

### Option 2: Use Tauri Shell Plugin (Simpler but Limited)
```rust
// Already installed, just use it
use tauri_plugin_shell::ShellExt;

#[tauri::command]
async fn execute_command(cmd: String) -> Result<String> {
    // Execute and return output
}
```

## 🎨 Matching the Dioxus UI Look

To make it look exactly like your current app:

### 1. Copy the styles
```css
/* Get dark theme colors from Dioxus */
:root {
  --bg-primary: #1e1e1e;
  --bg-secondary: #252526;
  --text-primary: #cccccc;
  --accent: #007acc;
}

/* VS Code-like layout */
.activity-bar { width: 48px; }
.sidebar { width: 240px; }
.editor { flex: 1; }
.terminal { height: 300px; }
```

### 2. Use the same layout structure
```typescript
// Exact same panel arrangement as Dioxus
<ResizablePanels>
  <Panel defaultSize={240} minSize={150}>
    <FileExplorer />
  </Panel>
  <Panel>
    <Tabs>
      <Tab>Consensus</Tab>
      <Tab>Editor</Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Panel>
  <Panel defaultSize={300}>
    <Terminal />
  </Panel>
</ResizablePanels>
```

## 🔄 Migration Strategy: Incremental

Instead of migrating everything at once, we can:

### Phase 1: Hybrid Approach (1 week)
Keep Dioxus app running, but:
1. Move consensus to Tauri backend
2. Use Tauri for file operations
3. Gradually port UI components

### Phase 2: Feature by Feature (2-3 weeks)
1. **Week 1**: Terminal + File Explorer
2. **Week 2**: LazyGit + Git Status
3. **Week 3**: Analytics + Settings

### Phase 3: Polish (1 week)
1. Keyboard shortcuts
2. Performance optimization
3. Testing & packaging

## 💡 Pro Tips for Fast Migration

### 1. Reuse Rust Code
Most of your Rust code can be copied directly:
```rust
// Just wrap existing functions in Tauri commands
#[tauri::command]
pub async fn your_existing_function() {
    // Your existing Rust code works here
}
```

### 2. Component by Component
Port one component at a time:
```typescript
// Start with simplest components
// StatusBar -> FileExplorer -> Terminal -> etc.
```

### 3. Use Ant Design Pro Components
They have pre-built components that match VS Code style:
- ProLayout for the main layout
- ProTable for data tables
- ProForm for settings

## 🎯 Today's Goal

Get the basic app running with:
1. ✅ Consensus working
2. ✅ File operations
3. ⬜ Terminal (next priority)
4. ⬜ LazyGit (after terminal)

Once terminal works, you'll have 80% functionality!

## 🚦 Go/No-Go Decision Point

After getting basic Tauri version running, evaluate:

**Go with Tauri if:**
- Performance is noticeably better ✅
- Binary size is <5MB ✅
- Development experience is good ✅
- Terminal integration works well ⏳

**Stay with Dioxus if:**
- Migration complexity too high ❌
- Lost features can't be recovered ❌
- Performance gain not significant ❌

## 📞 Need Help?

The Tauri community is very active:
- Discord: 17,000+ members
- GitHub: Fast response to issues
- Docs: Comprehensive examples

Common issues already solved:
- Terminal integration: Multiple examples available
- Git integration: Several apps do this
- Monaco editor: Well-documented

## 🎊 The Payoff

Once migrated, you get:
- **2-3MB** installers (vs 15MB)
- **Native performance** 
- **Mobile apps** for free
- **Auto-updates** built-in
- **Production stability** (ChatGPT Desktop uses Tauri!)

Start with `npm run tauri:dev` and see it running, then incrementally add features!
