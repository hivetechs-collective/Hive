## 🚀 Installation Experience

### One-Command Installation
```bash
# Universal installer (like Claude Code)
curl -fsSL https://hivetechs.com/install.sh | sh

# Alternative methods
brew install hivetechs/tap/hive          # macOS/Linux
winget install HiveTechs.HiveAI          # Windows
npm install -g @hivetechs/hive-ai        # Node.js
```

### Auto-Update System
```bash
hive self-update                    # Check and install updates
hive self-update --check-only       # Check without installing
hive self-update --rollback         # Rollback to previous version
```

### Migration from TypeScript
```bash
hive migrate                        # Auto-detect and migrate
hive migrate --from ~/.hive.old     # Migrate from specific location
hive migrate --dry-run --verify     # Preview migration
```

### Shell Completions
```bash
hive completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/hive
hive completion zsh > ~/.zsh/completions/_hive
hive completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/hive.fish
```
