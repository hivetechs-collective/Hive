## [2.3.6] - 2025-07-04

### 🎯 Complete TUI Layout Fix: Persistent Input Box Claude Code Style

#### Fixed
- ✅ **Persistent Input Box**: Fixed fundamental issue where input box would "disappear" during consensus streaming
- ✅ **Stable Layout Constraints**: Replaced dynamic layout switching with stable bounded constraint system
- ✅ **Bounded Messages Area**: Messages area now uses `Constraint::Max()` instead of `Constraint::Min()` to prevent expansion
- ✅ **Separate Consensus Panel**: Moved consensus progress to dedicated panel instead of inline to prevent layout conflicts
- ✅ **Visual Separation**: Added proper borders to all panels for clear visual distinction

#### Technical Root Cause Resolution
- 🔧 **Layout System**: Eliminated dynamic constraint switching between 3-panel and 4-panel layouts during consensus
- 🔧 **Constraint Bounds**: Calculate maximum messages height to reserve space for input box: `terminal_height - input_height - status_height - consensus_height`
- 🔧 **Panel Management**: Input box always at fixed position regardless of consensus state
- 🔧 **Scroll Bounds**: Proper scroll calculations that don't affect overall layout structure

#### User Experience Transformation
- **Before**: Input box appeared to vanish during streaming, text pushed interface elements around
- **After**: Input box permanently visible at bottom with consistent layout, text streams above in bounded area
- **Claude Code Match**: Now perfectly matches Claude Code's persistent input behavior with text flowing above
- **Professional UX**: Stable, predictable interface that maintains visual consistency during AI operations

#### Architecture Enhancement
- **Bounded Constraints**: Messages area can't expand beyond calculated maximum to preserve input space
- **Consistent Layout**: Same 4-panel structure always (messages, consensus, input, status) with dynamic visibility
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear panel separation with borders and titles for professional appearance
- **Performance**: Eliminated layout recalculation overhead during consensus streaming

This release completely solves the core architectural issue causing the input box to appear to disappear. The interface now maintains perfect stability and visual consistency, matching Claude Code's professional user experience.

## [2.3.5] - 2025-07-04

### 🎯 Complete TUI Experience Fix: Input Box & Scrolling

#### Fixed
- ✅ **Always Visible Input Box**: Fixed cursor disappearing during consensus - input box now always shows active cursor
- ✅ **Manual Scrolling Preserved**: Users can now scroll up during consensus streaming and stay at their chosen position  
- ✅ **Scroll Lock During Consensus**: Manual scroll position is no longer overridden by auto-scroll during streaming
- ✅ **Readable Consensus Results**: Users can scroll back to read consensus results while new streaming continues
- ✅ **Smart Auto-Scroll**: Only auto-scrolls to bottom when user hasn't manually scrolled up

#### Technical Changes
- 🔧 **Input Cursor Logic**: Changed from conditional (`if !input_buffer.is_empty()`) to always show cursor
- 🔧 **Scroll State Management**: Added `manual_scroll_active` flag to track user scrolling vs auto-scroll
- 🔧 **Scroll Preservation**: Modified message rendering to respect manual scroll position during consensus
- 🔧 **Intelligent Scroll Reset**: Auto-scroll only resumes when user scrolls back to bottom naturally

#### User Experience Transformation
- **Before**: Input box disappeared during consensus, couldn't scroll back to read results
- **After**: Input box always visible with cursor, can scroll up to read previous results during streaming
- **Claude Code Experience**: Now matches Claude Code's behavior with persistent input and scrollable history
- **Professional UX**: Maintains focus and readability during intensive AI consensus operations

#### Root Cause Analysis Completed
- **Multi-Agent Investigation**: Used 4 specialized agents to analyze layout, scrolling, input behavior, and rendering
- **Systematic Fixes**: Addressed cursor visibility, auto-scroll override, manual scroll preservation, and performance
- **Comprehensive Solution**: Fixed both immediate symptoms and underlying architectural issues

This release transforms the TUI from a problematic interface to a professional Claude Code-style experience where users maintain full control over input and scrolling during AI consensus operations.

## [2.3.4] - 2025-07-04

### 🔧 Critical Fix: Async Runtime Panic Resolution

#### Fixed
- ✅ **Async/Await Issue**: Fixed "attempted to block the current thread" panic in TUI consensus engine
- ✅ **Database Connections**: Converted `database_simple::get_connection()` to async with proper await handling
- ✅ **TUI Stability**: TUI now launches without runtime panics and displays real AI consensus responses
- ✅ **Consensus Models**: Fixed all async database calls in model management and consensus pipeline

#### Technical Changes
- 🔧 **database_simple.rs**: Changed `get_connection()` from `blocking_read()` to `config.read().await`
- 🔧 **consensus/engine.rs**: Added proper `.await` to database connection calls in async contexts
- 🔧 **consensus/models.rs**: Fixed multiple `get_connection()` calls to use async/await pattern
- 🔧 **TUI Integration**: Real AI responses now work properly without blocking the async runtime

#### User Experience
- **Before**: TUI crashed with async runtime panic: "attempted to block the current thread while the thread is being used to drive asynchronous tasks"
- **After**: TUI launches successfully and processes real AI consensus responses with proper streaming
- **Performance**: Eliminated blocking operations that caused runtime conflicts
- **Reliability**: Stable consensus engine operation in TUI mode

This critical fix resolves the main blocking issue preventing TUI from working with real AI consensus responses. Users can now enjoy the full Claude Code-style experience with actual OpenRouter API integration.

## [2.3.3] - 2025-07-04

### 🔧 Critical Fix: TUI Consensus Engine Database Connection

#### Fixed
- ✅ **Real AI Integration**: Fixed TUI consensus engine initialization with proper database connection
- ✅ **Database Connection**: TUI now properly connects to ~/.hive/hive-ai.db for configuration and profiles
- ✅ **Configuration Loading**: Consensus engine now loads real API keys and settings from config file
- ✅ **No More Simulation**: Eliminated fallback to simulation mode when real engine should be used

#### Technical Changes
- 🔧 **TuiApp::new()**: Now properly initializes database with `Database::open_default()`
- 🔧 **reload_consensus_engine()**: Fixed to use real database connection instead of `None`
- 🔧 **Consensus Pipeline**: Real 4-stage consensus now works in TUI mode with proper streaming

#### User Experience
- **Before**: TUI fell back to simulation mode even with valid API keys
- **After**: TUI uses real OpenRouter API with actual AI consensus responses
- **Performance**: Real AI responses with proper cost tracking and model usage
- **Streaming**: Actual token streaming with real consensus progress

This critical fix ensures that when you have valid OpenRouter API keys configured, the TUI will use the real consensus engine instead of falling back to simulation mode.
