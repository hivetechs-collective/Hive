# Borrow Checker Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the borrow checker errors that were fixed in the Hive AI Rust codebase.

## Fixed Errors

### 1. E0502: Cannot borrow as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
**Files affected:**
- `src/tui/advanced/consensus.rs` (lines 758, 835)
- `src/tui/advanced/command_palette.rs` (line 570)

**Fix:** Inlined the item creation logic to avoid overlapping borrows between self and self.list_state.

### 2. E0382: Borrow of moved value
**Files affected:**
- `src/core/license.rs` (lines 233, 243) - Fixed by adding `Copy` trait to `LicenseTier` enum
- `src/consensus/openrouter.rs` (lines 130, 170) - Fixed by storing status before using response
- `src/cli/framework.rs` (lines 189, 351) - Fixed by borrowing instead of moving with `&`
- `src/consensus/models.rs` (line 690) - Fixed by cloning String fields

### 3. E0499: Multiple mutable borrows
No instances of this error were found in the codebase.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Copy trait to LicenseTier
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, Serialize, Deserialize, PartialEq)]
pub enum LicenseTier {
    // ...
}
```

### 2. Fixed response status extraction in OpenRouter
```rust
// Before: response.status() called after response moved
// After:
let status = response.status();
if !status.is_success() {
    let error_text = response.text().await.unwrap_or_default();
    anyhow::bail!("OpenRouter API error {}: {}", status, error_text);
}
```

### 3. Fixed ConsensusResult field access
```rust
// Before: if let Some(answer) = result.result
// After:
if let Some(answer) = &result.result {
    // ...
}
```

### 4. Fixed TUI render methods
Inlined item creation logic to avoid borrowing self while also trying to borrow self.list_state mutably.

### 5. Added clone() calls for String fields
```rust
openrouter_id: model.openrouter_id.clone(),
provider: model.provider_name.clone(),
features: model.capabilities.clone(),
```

## Result

All borrow checker errors (E0502, E0382, E0499) have been successfully resolved. The codebase now compiles without these specific borrow checker issues.
