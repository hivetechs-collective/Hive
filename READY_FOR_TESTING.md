## âœ… App is Running
The desktop app is currently running (PID: 23742). You can interact with it now.

## ðŸ”§ Fixes Applied

### 1. Get Started Button
- âœ… Fixed: Button now properly closes the dialog
- âœ… Added: Automatic marking of onboarding completion in database
- âœ… Added: Debug logging to track button clicks

### 2. Database Setup
- âœ… Database initialized at: `~/.hive/hive-ai.db`
- âœ… All necessary tables created
- âœ… Migration marked as complete
- âœ… Onboarding completion flag set

### 3. Key Features Confirmed
- âœ… **"Add All 10 Expert Templates"** button exists on profile screen
- âœ… Keys save immediately on each step transition
- âœ… Visual indicators show when keys are already configured
- âœ… Dialog can be closed by clicking overlay or Get Started button

## ðŸ§ª Test the Following

1. **Check if onboarding dialog appears**
   - If it doesn't appear, that's good - it means onboarding is marked complete
   - To reset: `sqlite3 ~/.hive/hive-ai.db "DELETE FROM configurations WHERE key = 'onboarding_completed';"`

2. **Test key saving**
   - Enter keys and move between steps
   - Keys should save immediately (check with query below)

3. **Test profile creation**
   - Look for the green "ðŸš€ Add All 10 Expert Templates" button
   - Click it to create all profiles at once

## ðŸ“Š Database Verification Commands

Check saved keys:
```bash
sqlite3 ~/.hive/hive-ai.db "SELECT key, substr(value, 1, 20) || '...' as value_preview FROM configurations WHERE key IN ('openrouter_api_key', 'hive_license_key');"
```

Check profiles:
```bash
sqlite3 ~/.hive/hive-ai.db "SELECT id, name, is_default FROM consensus_profiles;"
```

Check onboarding status:
```bash
sqlite3 ~/.hive/hive-ai.db "SELECT key, value FROM configurations WHERE key = 'onboarding_completed';"
```

## ðŸ”„ To Reset and Test Again

1. Stop the app: `pkill -f hive-consensus`
2. Clear onboarding: `sqlite3 ~/.hive/hive-ai.db "DELETE FROM configurations WHERE key = 'onboarding_completed';"`
3. Restart: `cargo run --bin hive-consensus`

The app is ready for your testing!
