## Overview (Manual Approach)
This document defines how Claude Code agents should be used manually to systematically migrate from TTYD to xterm.js + PTY architecture. Agents work in parallel to maximize efficiency while maintaining code quality.

## Agent Roles & Responsibilities

### 1. Architecture Agent
**Purpose**: Design decisions, pattern analysis, system design

**Responsibilities**:

- Review integration points
- Validate architectural decisions
- Create technical specifications

**When to Use**:
- Before implementing new components
- When making architectural decisions
- For pattern discovery in large codebases
- Validating approach against industry standards

**Example Invocation**:
```
Analyze VS Code's ptyService.ts implementation and create a technical specification
for our PtyService.ts that follows their patterns while integrating with our existing
PtyManager.ts for AI CLI tools.
```

### 2. Implementation Agent
**Purpose**: Code generation, refactoring, feature implementation

**Responsibilities**:
- Write new TypeScript/JavaScript code
- Refactor existing code
- Implement IPC handlers
- Create React components
- Follow established patterns

**When to Use**:

- Coordinating renderer ‚Üî main process

**Example Invocation**:
```
Integrate xterm.js in TerminalManager.ts with the new PtyService via IPC:
1. Set up IPC listeners in renderer
2. Connect xterm.onData to IPC send
3. Connect IPC receive to xterm.write
4. Handle resize events
5. Test bidirectional data flow
Ensure AI CLI tools continue working during integration.
```

## Parallel Agent Workflow Patterns

### Pattern 1: Research + Implementation
**Use When**: Starting new features

```
Agent 1 (Architecture): Research VS Code patterns for feature X
Agent 2 (Documentation): Review existing documentation for related features
‚Üí Wait for completion
‚Üí Agent 3 (Implementation): Implement feature X using findings
‚Üí Agent 4 (Testing): Create tests for feature X
```

### Pattern 2: Parallel Implementation
**Use When**: Multiple independent components

```
Agent 1: Create PtyService.ts
Agent 2: Refactor terminal-ipc-handlers.ts
Agent 3: Update TerminalManager.ts
Agent 4: Create test suite
‚Üí All agents run in parallel
‚Üí Agent 5 (Integration): Connect all components
```

### Pattern 3: Phased Migration
**Use When**: Migrating large systems

```
Phase 1:
  Agent 1: Analyze current TTYD implementation
  Agent 2: Design PTY replacement architecture

Phase 2:
  Agent 3: Implement PtyService (parallel)
  Agent 4: Implement xterm integration (parallel)
  Agent 5: Create tests (parallel)

Phase 3:
  Agent 6: Integration testing
  Agent 7: Migration cleanup

Phase 4:
  Agent 8: Documentation updates
```

## Agent Coordination Rules

### 1. File-Level Locking
- Only one agent modifies a file at a time
- Declare file intentions upfront
- Wait for completion before dependent work

### 2. Communication Protocol
Agents report status in this format:
```
Agent [Role]: [Task Name]
Status: [In Progress | Completed | Blocked]
Files Modified: [list]
Dependencies: [what's needed to proceed]
Next: [what comes after this]
```

### 3. Dependency Management
```
Agent A creates PtyService.ts
  ‚Üì (blocks)
Agent B refactors IPC handlers (needs PtyService interface)
  ‚Üì (blocks)
Agent C integrates components (needs both A and B)
```

### 4. Quality Gates
Before marking complete, agents must:
- ‚úÖ Code compiles without errors
- ‚úÖ No TypeScript type errors
- ‚úÖ Tests pass (if applicable)
- ‚úÖ Documentation updated
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes to existing features

## Agent Invocation Examples

### Example 1: Create New Component
```
Task: Create PtyService.ts

Agent Type: Implementation
Context: We're migrating from TTYD to node-pty. PtyService should manage
terminal processes using node-pty, following VS Code's ptyService pattern.

Requirements:
- Location: src/main/terminal/PtyService.ts
- Follow patterns from existing PtyManager.ts for AI CLI tools
- Expose methods: spawn, write, resize, kill
- Emit events: onData, onExit
- Handle multiple terminal instances
- Proper error handling and cleanup

Reference Files:
- electron-poc/src/main/terminal/PtyManager.ts (existing patterns)
- VS Code: src/vs/platform/terminal/node/ptyService.ts (industry pattern)

Return: Complete TypeScript implementation with comments
```

### Example 2: Research Task
```
Task: Analyze xterm.js integration patterns

Agent Type: Architecture
Context: Need to understand how VS Code integrates xterm.js in their renderer
process to replicate their proven approach.

Tasks:
1. Search VS Code codebase for xterm.js usage
2. Identify initialization patterns
3. Find data flow (IPC ‚Üí xterm)
4. Document event handling
5. Note performance optimizations

Return: Technical specification with code examples showing:
- How xterm Terminal is created
- How data flows from IPC to xterm
- How resize is handled
- How addons are used
```

### Example 3: Integration Task
```
Task: Connect xterm.js to PtyService via IPC

Agent Type: Integration
Context: PtyService exists in main process, xterm.js in renderer.
Need bidirectional data flow.

Steps:
1. Update TerminalManager.ts to listen for IPC messages
2. Connect xterm.onData ‚Üí IPC send to main process
3. Connect IPC receive from main ‚Üí xterm.write
4. Handle terminal lifecycle (spawn, destroy)
5. Test with basic shell commands

Files to Modify:
- src/components/terminal/TerminalManager.ts
- src/preload.ts (if needed)

Return: Working integration with test results
```

## Success Criteria

### For Each Agent Task:
- ‚úÖ Deliverable is complete and functional
- ‚úÖ Code follows existing patterns
- ‚úÖ TypeScript types are correct
- ‚úÖ No console errors or warnings
- ‚úÖ Documentation updated (if applicable)
- ‚úÖ Tests pass (if applicable)

### For Migration Overall:
- ‚úÖ All TTYD code removed
- ‚úÖ xterm.js + PTY working perfectly
- ‚úÖ AI CLI tools still functional
- ‚úÖ Performance equal or better than TTYD
- ‚úÖ No quarantine/signing issues
- ‚úÖ Homebrew distribution works
- ‚úÖ User experience smooth and professional

## Rollback Strategy

If migration encounters critical issues:

```
Agent (Migration): Rollback to TTYD
1. Restore TTYDManager.ts from git history
2. Revert IPC handler changes
3. Restore webview-based terminal panel
4. Remove xterm.js integration
5. Verify TTYD works locally (but note: still has distribution issues)
```

## Notes for Claude Code

- **Use agents liberally** - they're designed for parallel work
- **Be specific** - detailed prompts get better results
- **Coordinate carefully** - respect file-level locking
- **Verify quality** - check agent work before proceeding
- **Document decisions** - maintain audit trail
- **Think in phases** - don't try to do everything at once

This migration is **perfect for agents** because:
1. Clear requirements and specifications
2. Well-defined component boundaries
3. Proven patterns to follow (VS Code)
4. Multiple independent tasks can run in parallel
5. Quality gates are objective and measurable
