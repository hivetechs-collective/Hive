# Gemini MCP Tool Invocation - Actual Issue

## Problem Identified
Gemini is NOT actually invoking the MCP tool. It's responding based on local file content instead of calling the Memory Service.

## How to Verify MCP is Actually Being Used

1. **Check Memory Service Dashboard**
   - If query count doesn't increase, MCP isn't being called
   - Dashboard should show the query from the tool

2. **Look for MCP Invocation Indicators**
   - Gemini should show something like "Calling MCP tool: query_memory_with_context"
   - There should be a loading/processing indicator for the MCP call

## Possible Correct Syntaxes to Try

### Option 1: Direct MCP Command
```bash
/mcp query_memory_with_context "what have we worked on"
```

### Option 2: Explicit Tool Call
```bash
/tool query_memory_with_context "what have we worked on"
```

### Option 3: Force MCP Usage
```bash
ctrl+t (to see available tools)
Then use the exact syntax shown for the tool
```

### Option 4: Check Gemini's MCP Syntax
```bash
/help mcp
# or
/help tools
```

## The Real Issue

Gemini might be:
1. Not properly connected to the MCP server
2. Not recognizing the tool invocation syntax
3. Defaulting to local file search instead of MCP

## Debugging Steps

1. **Press Ctrl+T** - See what tools are listed
2. **Check MCP Status** - Is the Memory Service MCP server running?
3. **Try Different Prefixes**:
   - `/mcp`
   - `/tool`
   - `/use`
   - `!mcp`
   
4. **Check Gemini Settings**:
   - Look for MCP auto-invoke configuration
   - Check if MCP needs to be explicitly enabled

## Expected Behavior When MCP Works

When MCP is properly invoked, you should see:
1. A processing indicator
2. Memory Service dashboard query count increases
3. Response includes memories from the database
4. Not just local file content

## Manual MCP Configuration Check

Check `~/.gemini/mcp-config.json` to ensure:
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "hive-memory-service": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["~/.hive/mcp-wrappers/gemini-cli-memory-service.js"],
      "env": {
        "MEMORY_SERVICE_ENDPOINT": "http://localhost:37352",
        "MEMORY_SERVICE_TOKEN": "..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```
