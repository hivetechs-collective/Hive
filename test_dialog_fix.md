# Dialog Fix Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Get Started Button Fix
- Added proper onboarding completion marking when Get Started is clicked
- Added detailed logging to track dialog closing
- Dialog can now also be closed by clicking the overlay

### 2. Add All 10 Profiles Button
- **Already exists!** Look for the prominent green button: "ðŸš€ Add All 10 Expert Templates"
- Located at the top of the profile configuration screen
- Creates all 10 expert profiles with one click

### 3. Key Status Indicators
- **Hive Key Screen**: Shows "âœ… A Hive license key is already configured" if key exists
- **OpenRouter Key Screen**: Shows "âœ… An OpenRouter API key already exists" if key exists
- Both screens display masked current key (e.g., "Current key: sk-or-v1-****abcd")

### 4. Immediate Key Saving
- Hive key now saves immediately when moving from step 2 to step 3
- No longer waits until the end to save keys
- Uses ApiKeyManager for consistent database operations

## Testing Instructions

1. Run the desktop app: `cargo run --bin hive-consensus`
2. The onboarding dialog should appear if no keys are configured
3. Enter keys and verify:
   - Keys save immediately when moving between steps
   - Existing key indicators appear
   - "Add All 10 Expert Templates" button is visible on profile screen
   - Get Started button closes the dialog

## Database Verification

Check if keys are saved:
```bash
sqlite3 ~/.hive/hive-ai.db "SELECT key, value FROM configurations WHERE key IN ('openrouter_api_key', 'hive_license_key', 'onboarding_completed');"
```

Check if profiles were created:
```bash
sqlite3 ~/.hive/hive-ai.db "SELECT name FROM consensus_profiles;"
```
